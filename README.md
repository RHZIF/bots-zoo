# Bots Zoo

For my different projects, I often have to launch bots using different kinds of browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Headless/not headless) using different automation frameworks (Puppeteer, Selenium, Playwright) in several programming languages. 

Since I'm juggling between different frameworks/languages, sometimes it's difficult to remember/find how to set up a particular kind of bot, or how to execute basic commands. 

That's why I've decided to centralize examples of simple bots in this repository. I hope it will also benefit other people.

For the moment I only have example for the following bots:
- Playwright (NodeJS only): Chromium, Webkit (Safari), Firefox
- Puppeteer (NodeJS only): Chromium, Firefox
- Selenium (NodeJS only): Chromium, Firefox
- Simple HTTP module/library (NodeJS + Cheerio): Sequential, Parallel

I will continue to add other examples, such as Playwright Firefox/WebKit, Selenium Firefox, both in NodeJS but also in other programming languages like Python.
I will also provide examples for bot frameworks that provide mechanisms against bot detection solutions.

The **headers** directory contains data related to HTTP headers.
For the moment, it contains only a list of ~16K user-agents.

**DON'T contact me** if you want to ask me how to make your bot(s) undetectable. 
You can find [articles on my website](https://antoinevastel.com/categories.html#Bot-detection-ref), but I won't provide more details since I'm working for a bot detection company.
